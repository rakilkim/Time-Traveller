## Project Structure

This project consists of three core modules:

### 1. Authentication Module
The Authentication Module handles user registration, login, session management, and secure access control.

- **Technologies:** Express.js, MongoDB, JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Features:**
  - User sign-up and login with hashed passwords
  - Token-based session validation
  - Retrieve and Post User Data to MongoDB

### 2. Forecasting Module
The Forecasting Module handles the creation of forecasts.

- **Technologies:** Python, FastAPI, Redis, statsmodels, and Prophet
- **Features:**
  - Supports forecasting methods such as ARIMA, ETS, Prophet, MAPA
  - Combines historical data preprocessing with model selection
  - Offers multi-step predictions with trend, seasonality, and residual modeling
  - Exposes a REST API for the frontend to consume forecast results

### 3. Frontend Module
The Frontend Module provides an interactive user interface for managing time series inputs and visualizing forecast results.

- **Technologies:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, uPlot, vite-plugin-pwa
- **Features:**
  - Dynamic plot rendering via uPlot with HTML5 `<canvas>`
  - Form controls for selecting forecast method, interval, and step count
  - Responsive, mobile-friendly UI
  - PWA support for offline usage and installable app behavior
